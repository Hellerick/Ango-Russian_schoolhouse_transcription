Because employers are constantly in competition with each other and need to maintain and raise their profits they are constantly on the search for new ways to squeeze more work from their workers. Wage cutting, intensifying work, reducing in work ‘benefits’ like paid holidays, sick pay, employers pension contributions and bringing in new ways of working are normal.

Capitalists have no choice in this. If they don’t compete efficiently in the capitalist market they go out of business or get taken over. Capitalists have always used new technologies to replace existing skills and intensify work. From the beginnings of the Industrial revolution to today the working class is constantly reshaped by changes in capitalist production. And capitalists have always relied on a churning labour market — a ‘reserve army of labour’ as the unemployed and underemployed, migrant workers and young workers entering the jobs market for the first time are in competition with more established workers.

Workers have learned to combine in unions in order to strengthen their negotiating position with the bosses. And the bosses have always used their control of the state, the police, the army, the media and the law to blunt the working class challenge to their power and ownership. That is why communists argue that trade union action is vital, but not enough. The working class needs its own independent political organisations to fight for its interests within capitalism and to provide the ideas, leadership and organisation to replace the capitalist system with working class political power and a socialist economic system. No one disputes that capitalism is in crisis.
